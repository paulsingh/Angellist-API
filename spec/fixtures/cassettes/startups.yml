        McClure is brilliant and genuinely cares about entrepreneurs like they were
        part of his family. The way he''s executed on creating a global network with
        Fund 1 is remarkable and just the beginning with Fund 2. I think a lot of
        people can confuse Dave''s outward PR persona with the real Dave who''s truly
        generous and is one of the hardest working role models I''ve ever had in my
        life. He''s intentionally designing the 500S brand to represent fun, family
        and meaningful emotional connections between people that will last for the
        long run. Sure he can''t answer every email because that doesn''t scale but
        he''s building a great team and community driven brand that is scaling. Christine
        Tsai is doing great work to cultivate a phenomenal mentor network and distribution
        platform relationships. Paul Singh is building game changing internal tools
        and applying many of the same data informed principles we expect of startups
        onto VC. Christen O''Brien is crafting amazing experiences through events
        and partnerships that continue to attract the best entrepreneurs to 500S worldwide...This
        is the inflection point you want to invest in as an LP.","created_at":"2012-04-17T07:55:58Z","user":{"name":"Enrique
